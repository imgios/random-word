# Random Word API

Random-word is a basic API that provides a word generated randomly with letters, numbers and special chars. I did it to learn Python and Flask.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to execute the API, you need:
- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/imgios/random-word.git
$ cd random-word
$ pip install flask
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
